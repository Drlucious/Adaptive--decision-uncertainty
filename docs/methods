# Methods and Implementation Notes

## Commitment Control
Participants must explicitly confirm numerical estimates and confidence ratings using a dedicated button. 
This prevents accidental or transient motor responses from being recorded as final judgments.

## Trial Independence
All response components are reset at the beginning of each trial 
to prevent carryover of previous responses or interaction states.

## No External Feedback
Trial-level correctness and points are not displayed. 
Points are accumulated internally and revealed only at the end of the experiment 
to ensure reliance on internal error monitoring rather than reinforcement learning.

## Confidence Measurement
Confidence is collected using a discrete five-point scale with a confirmation step. 
Reaction times are logged to index metacognitive deliberation latency.

## Threshold Rule
Estimation accuracy is defined using a symmetric ±2 threshold 
relative to the true value rather than exact matching, modeling tolerance-based accuracy.

## Data Integrity
Raw numerical estimates are logged prior to outcome evaluation,
ensuring that belief states are preserved independently from reward computation.
